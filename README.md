Hello. Thank you for visiting this GitHub page which contains the data availability for our paper entitled "The role of polyploidy and horizontal transfer when describing transposable element proliferation within Neotropical Corydoradinae catfishes" (Butler et al, 2022).

Here you can find
1) Figures -  both main text and suppplementary figures are found in both PDF and PowerPoint format
2) Code - most analysis in this mansucript was conducted within R. All necessary data and scripts are provided for repeatability. Within each figure's subfolder you will see the R script, and a html code report that includes commentary, source code, and script output.

For ease of use, file and folder navigation are conducted relative to the current script location within GitHub. This was handily achieved using the rstudioapi package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstudioapi/rstudioapi.pdf (getActiveProject).

If you are having trouble rendering html files provided please use the following service https://htmlpreview.github.io/

If you have any questions regarding this content please do get into contact with myself at 96clbutler@gmail.com.
